    "text": "Task 1:\nDescribe your research question and provide some background on why you find it interesting or important. Be sure to incorporate the feedback provided on the first assignment. Include references to at least two pieces of existing research that illustrate what has already been discovered about the relationship you are investigating. This could be articles published in academic journals, policy reports and white papers, articles published by think tanks and other credible organizations (ex. Brookings, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, etc.), or pieces of data journalism. A full-credit response will probably be around 150-200 words. (40%)\n\nDescription of research question, background, and why its a personal interest:\nThe research question explores the impact of LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion on a country’s tourism industry. This inquiry is motivated by observations and claims that countries with more inclusive LGBTQ+ rights may attract more tourists, thus benefiting economically. The relevance of this question extends beyond economic considerations, touching on global development issues and the social progress embodied in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 10 on reducing inequalities. Recent legislative changes, such as those in Uganda, and their potential economic repercussions highlight the urgency of understanding this dynamic. The study aims to quantitatively measure the relationship between LGBTQ+ rights—using indices like the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide—and tourism metrics, offering insights into how inclusivity influences economic outcomes.\nOn a more personal level, as an LGBTQ person, when thinking about programs available to me as a student at Penn, such as Penn Global Seminars, study abroad programs, and Global Research and Internship Programs, I have had to consider the countries I would be able to safely live and work in. Having spent a lot of time at the intersection of LGBTQ+ policy and business I often hear about the business impact and I feel this is one way in which I could contribute to broader findings, as I have not found any explicit research connected to the relationship between tourism and LGBTQ+ friendliness.\nPotential sources that cover this topic:\nTitle: LGBT tourist decision-making and behaviours. A study of Millennial Italian tourists (link)\nAuthor: Salvatore Monaco\nJournal: International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy\nDate: 11 August 2022\nThe study investigates how Italian LGBT Millennials make travel decisions, emphasizing the influence of ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors on their destination choices. Utilizing an online survey distributed through social networks and LGBTQ+ community platforms, it provides insights into the preferences and motivations behind their travel behaviors. This research is relevant as it proves there are specific needs and considerations of LGBT tourists, offering a perspective on how inclusive policies and societal attitudes might impact tourism choices.\nTitle: The Relationship Between LGBT Inclusion and Economic Development: Emerging Economies (link)\nAuthors: M.V. Lee Badgett, Sheila Nezhad, Kees Waaldijk, Yana van der Meulen Rodgers\nInstitution: Williams Institute at UCLA\nDate: November 2014\nThis comprehensive study explores the correlation between the social inclusion of LGBT individuals and economic development across 39 countries. The research employs both micro and macro-level analyses to examine the impact of LGBT inclusion on a country’s economic performance. Findings indicate a positive relationship between the degree of legal rights granted to LGBT individuals and economic indicators such as GDP per capita. The study provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that greater LGBT inclusion is associated with stronger economic outcomes, emphasizing the importance of anti-discrimination laws and their direct economic relevance. This research contributes significantly to understanding the economic implications of LGBT rights and inclusion on a global scale. While not specifically related to tourism, this research could serve as a model to follow/base my research off of.\n\n\n\nTask 2:\nState at least one testable hypothesis. Distill your research question into a statement about a specific relationship you expect to see in the world. In most cases, this hypothesis will describe a causal relationship between two variables (i.e. changes in x cause changes in y). Make an argument for why you expect to see this relationship. This should be based on related findings from existing research and/or your own theoretical/logical reasoning. A full-credit response will probably be around 150-200 words. (25%)\n\nPossible hypothesis\nDecreases in LGBTQ friendliness variables that hinder tourism in a given country will result in a decrease in tourism volume to the country, as measured by number of arrivals.\nWhy?\nAs I have discussed in Checkpoint 1 and above, there is often lots of activists that claim that it is actually costly to countries that are anti-lgbtq because they lose money from tourism and more. As the research iI cited in task 1, the Badgett et al. piece clearly demonstrates how LGBTQ friendliness has an effect on the economy. Secondly, in the first piece of research (as well as a few other older studies show) we know that LGBTQ people consider such factors when traveling, with some research saying LGBTQ friendliness has stronger effects than recent terrorism in the country. Anyway, theoretically less people in the LGBTQ communities should be likely to travel to a place after it has regressed on LGBTQ friendliness. The vise versa should also be true. As countries become more supportive of LGBTQ communities I would expect that more lgbtq people would be willing to travel there and thereby effect tourism volume.\nPlease feel free to skip these next

Be sure to mention the source of the data (the organization or individuals that produced it), the unit of analysis, and the sample. Create a ggplot to visualize the relationship between the variables being used to test your hypothesis. The best method of visualizing this relationship will depend on the scale of your variables. Good methods to consider are scatter plots (for continuous variables), grouped bar charts (for ordinal or binary variables), and line graphs (for continuous variables with time-series). (25%)\n\nDiscussion of key variables\nDependent Variable\n\nTourism volume percent change from the previous year (tour_pct):\n\nThis represents tourism data collected from the world bank and the world tourism association. You can see in the above code segments how I cleaned, pivoteded, mutated, merged, and more to turn the data from country, year 1, year 2, year n, in which the values were the number of tourist arrivals in that year. Note I only use starting 2012 because of limits of the independent variable, and I don’t use anything after FY 2019 because of covid-related shocks. Final unit of analysis is by country and year. Sample is not just countries but also territories (ex: US Virgin Islands), regions (ex: MENA), and other buckets such as income buckets which I discarded.\n\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nTotal\n\nThis represents the total score a country gets in a given year from the Gay Spartacus Travel Index. Each country was scored starting 2012, on a variety of different features (see other variables). Scores centered around 0 and countries can either earn points or loose points. The GSTI cites a variety of different sources including IGLA, Rainbow Europe, the UN, and more.\nIn order to get this into a workable format I had to get PDFs to EXCLs to CSVs and then spend a lot of time cleaning the data, pivoting, merging re-poviting, etc. See above code segements for more specifics, but I got the unit of analysis down to country year, such that the df looks like: Country, Year, Total, Specific LGBT variable 1, Specific LGBT variable 2, Specific LGBT variable …n. Sample ranges specifically from year to year but generally includes UN-recognized countries.\n\n\nI only will cover a few examples because the process is the pretty similar for all of the LGBT variables since it comes from the same org and report.\n\nAdoption allowed\n\nThis is a pretty clear measure where its very simple to see whether or not adoption is allowed, and for the most part this functions as a binary variable.\n\nAntidiscrimination\n\n“With regard to anti-discrimination laws up to 3 points can be awarded, making a distinction, for example, whether the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the constitution or only in a law for a specific area is shown.” (direct wording from the GSTI).\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_all_final, \n       aes(x = as.factor(Total), \n           y = tour_pct)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Total change in LGBTQ+ scores\", \n       y = \"Change in Tourism Arrivals by Volume\", \n       title = \"Does changes in LGBTQ friendliness impact tourism volume? No.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_all_final, \n       aes(x = Total, \n           y = tour_pct)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method=lm) + \n  labs(x = \"Total change in LGBTQ+ scores\", \n       y = \"Change in Tourism Arrivals by Volume\", \n       title = \"Does changes in LGBTQ friendliness impact tourism volume? No.\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 205 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 205 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4:\nSpecify the main regression model you will use to test your hypothesis. This regression model should provide a preliminary test for or against the validity of your hypothesis. Use markdown to render the equation neatly to the html file. (10%)\n\nAfter some discussion with you, I have decided that the simplest regression model is best. Because I am looking at percent change, there is an effect similar to FE that already controls for country size.\n\\[\nPercent\\ Change\\ Tourism\\ Volume_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1( Change\\ in\\ LGBTQ\\ Friendliness\\ Variables)_{i1} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nA note on AI\nI used GPT4 many times throughout this assignment. Noteably in helping me code in time saving measures (instead of calculating the percent change by hand for 12+ variables and over 9 times each) I got it to give me the code to do it automatically. Moreover, especially with the chaos that is pivoting I used it to help me ID rows using str type commands. I also used GPT4 to help with editing, debugging, trying to use python instead (did not go with in the end), as well as some editing/rephrasing and reworking of my explanations and responses."

    "text": "Task 2: Data\nData Souces\nIn this research, I am employing two different data sources. In order to asses the dependent/outcome variable, tourism volume, I am utilizing the World Bank’s International tourism, number of arrivalsmeasures. The downloadable data set has data at the country and year level. For example, it has the number of tourist arrivals to the United States in 2014. Note that the data is not perfect, there is some missing data for specific countries and years.\nThe second datset is the from the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide which pubishes yearly reports on each country and variety of different metrics, from whether or not Pride festivals and parades are banned in a given country and year to whether there is HIV-related travel restrictions.\nWhile the data was relatively complete, I did narrow down the years I would work with. I decided to not use any data starting from Janurary 1, 2020, to remove the issue with COVID-related travel dilemmas.

For example, common travel locations, such as Greece, are going to generally just have more travel, even against some similar sized or population sized countries. So its not as much controlling against just the population size, but by using percent change in tourist volume as the outcome, this adjusts for the normal level of travel to a given country more or less applying country fixed effects.\nCausal Relationship & Potential Unobserved Cofounders\nA significant challenge to the interpretabitiy of this model is the presence of unobserved confounders that could influence both LGBTQ+ policies and tourism volume, such as broader, economic conditions, political stability, or even year.\n\nFor example, lets take a deeper look into political stability—often times political instability results in the claw back of demographic rights. Its entirely possible that far-right or other massive shifts in a countries government are both the cause of changes to LGBTQ friendliness and changes to the tourist volume.\nTake another example, year, its possible that the year it is has an effect on LGBTQ friendliness score and then also year has an impact on tourism—for example, its possible that tourism for whatever reason just declined in 2013.\nAnother potential mechanism for influence not captured in the data is media coverage and awareness this hypothesis only works under the assumption that potential tourists are aware of the status of LGBTQ friendliness in a given country."

    "text": "Task 4: Empirical Extension\nI’m not 100% percent sure what exactly I want to use as the empirical extension (or multiple of them), so I just wanted to give you a few options and then I also booked time for us to chat on Friday to workshop it together.\nThere are a variety of ways to help strengthen our conclusion, even if it is that there is no relationship between these variables. Below are some things that I could empoy, considering that my main model is listed above.\n\nNew Index Variables: Add an additional mode that instead of just total score as the independent variable, use all the sub components of the total. By doing this I could isolate to see if there is something specific that matters and not necessarily just the total score. In this I could also try many different combinations, where I hypothesize that these are the subcomponents that I think will have an impact on tourism and then use those or even create an index variable for it and then control it against the factors that I don’t think matter.\nYear Fixed Effects: While my main model is already employing an effect simiar to fixed effects by doing country percent change, I could employ fixed effects for the year. For example, what if global tourism just declined in 2018? This then could help absorb some of those shocks. Not only could this help remove the effect of year, it also (partially) helps mediate concerns about global macroeconomic conditions that would impede or support increased tourism.\nCountry Fixed Effects: Implement country fixed effects in my regression models to control for all time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between countries, which might influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism. This is also partially accounted for by %change but there could be other factors (for ex maybe this shows me that only particular regions is there an actual relationsip)\nSimplifying the model: I could try to run a mode that predicts a just the direction of tourism change. Instead of having it be a continous variable I could make it just an binary variable that represents whether or not the country experienced an increase or a decrease in tourism.\nRegional Analysis: Conduct separate analyses for different regions (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa) to account for regional variations in cultural, economic, and political factors that could influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism independently.\nEconomic Controls: Include GDP per capita and economic growth rates in your model to control for the overall economic environment of the country, which could independently affect tourism volumes.\nTime-Lagged Variables: I could use lagged values (1-2 years) of the LGBTQ+ friendliness measures to examine if changes in LGBTQ+ policies impact tourism with a time delay, which would help clarify direction (not that I am particularly concerned about tourism rates impacting LGBTQ+ friendliness)\nDifference-in-Differences: I could empoy a difference-in-differences approach where I compare changes in tourism volumes in countries that improved on LGBTQ+ legislation against those that did not over the same period. The only issue is then I would have to pick a specific year and then that would reduce the models range. However this could help cover countries that were already improving/not improving at a steady rate."

Noteably in helping me code in time saving measures (instead of calculating the percent change by hand for 12+ variables and over 9 times each) I got it to give me the code to do it automatically. Moreover, especially with the chaos that is pivoting I used it to help me ID rows using str type commands. I also used GPT4 to help with editing, debugging, trying to use python instead (did not go with in the end), as well as some editing/rephrasing and reworking of my explanations and responses. Moreover, I used it to help brainstorm some potential confounders (was okay at doing it) and then also used it to help brainstorm remedies (was meh at it)."

    "text": "Task 2: Data\nData Souces\nIn this research, I am employing two different data sources. In order to asses the dependent/outcome variable, tourism volume, I am utilizing the World Bank’s International tourism, number of arrivalsmeasures. The downloadable data set has data at the country and year level. For example, it has the number of tourist arrivals to the United States in 2014. Note that the data is not perfect, there is some missing data for specific countries and years.\nThe second datset is the from the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide which pubishes yearly reports on each country and variety of different metrics, from whether or not Pride festivals and parades are banned in a given country and year to whether there is HIV-related travel restrictions.\nWhile the data was relatively complete, I did narrow down the years I would work with. I decided to not use any data starting from Janurary 1, 2020, to remove the issue with COVID-related travel dilemmas. Because the Gay Travel Guide only begins in 2012, the final window is for 2012-2019 and for all countries that existed in both the Gay Travel Guide and the World Bank Travel Data.\nDiscussion of key variables\nDependent Variable\n\nTourism volume percent change from the previous year (tour_pct):\n\nFinal unit of analysis is by country and year. Sample is not just countries but also territories (ex: US Virgin Islands), regions (ex: MENA), and other buckets such as income buckets (developing) which I discarded.\n\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nTotal\n\nThis represents the total score a country gets in a given year from the Gay Spartacus Travel Index. Each country was scored startingon a variety of different features (see other variables). Scores centered around 0 and countries can either earn points or loose points. The GSTI cites a variety of different sources including IGLA, Rainbow Europe, the UN, and more.\nIn order to get this into a workable format I had to get PDFs to EXCLs to CSVs and then spend a lot of time cleaning the data, pivoting, merging re-poviting, etc. See above code segements for more specifics, but I got the unit of analysis down to country year, such that the df looks like: Country, Year, Total, Specific LGBT variable 1, Specific LGBT variable 2, Specific LGBT variable …n. Sample ranges specifically from year to year but generally includes UN-recognized countries.\n\nAdoption allowed: This is a pretty clear measure where its very simple to see whether or not adoption is allowed, and for the most part this functions as a binary variable.\nAntidiscrimination: “With regard to anti-discrimination laws up to 3 points can be awarded, making a distinction, for example, whether the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the constitution or only in a law for a specific area is shown.” (direct wording from the GSTI).\nMarriage / Partnership: is the status on same-sex marriage, partnerships, and unions look like.

For example, common travel locations, such as Greece, are going to generally just have more travel, even against some similar sized or population sized countries. So its not as much controlling against just the population size, but by using percent change in tourist volume as the outcome, this adjusts for the normal level of travel to a given country more or less applying country fixed effects.\nCausal Relationship & Potential Unobserved Cofounders\nA significant challenge to the interpretabitiy of this model is the presence of unobserved confounders that could influence both LGBTQ+ policies and tourism volume, such as broader, economic conditions, political stability, or even year.\n\nFor example, lets take a deeper look into political stability—often times political instability results in the claw back of demographic rights. Its entirely possible that far-right or other massive shifts in a countries government are both the cause of changes to LGBTQ friendliness and changes to the tourist volume.\nTake another example, year, its possible that the year it is has an effect on LGBTQ friendliness score and then also year has an impact on tourism—for example, its possible that tourism for whatever reason just declined in 2013.\nAnother potential mechanism for influence not captured in the data is media coverage and awareness this hypothesis only works under the assumption that potential tourists are aware of the status of LGBTQ friendliness in a given country."

    "text": "Task 4: Empirical Extension\nI’m not 100% percent sure what exactly I want to use as the empirical extension (or multiple of them), so I just wanted to give you a few options and then I also booked time for us to chat on Friday to workshop it together.\nThere are a variety of ways to help strengthen our conclusion, even if it is that there is no relationship between these variables. Below are some things that I could empoy, considering that my main model is listed above.\n\nNew Index Variables: Add an additional mode that instead of just total score as the independent variable, use all the sub components of the total. By doing this I could isolate to see if there is something specific that matters and not necessarily just the total score. In this I could also try many different combinations, where I hypothesize that these are the subcomponents that I think will have an impact on tourism and then use those or even create an index variable for it and then control it against the factors that I don’t think matter.\nYear Fixed Effects: While my main model is already employing an effect simiar to fixed effects by doing country percent change, I could employ fixed effects for the year. For example, what if global tourism just declined in 2018? This then could help absorb some of those shocks. Not only could this help remove the effect of year, it also (partially) helps mediate concerns about global macroeconomic conditions that would impede or support increased tourism.\nCountry Fixed Effects: Implement country fixed effects in my regression models to control for all time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between countries, which might influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism. This is also partially accounted for by %change but there could be other factors (for ex maybe this shows me that only particular regions is there an actual relationsip)\nSimplifying the model: I could try to run a mode that predicts a just the direction of tourism change. Instead of having it be a continous variable I could make it just an binary variable that represents whether or not the country experienced an increase or a decrease in tourism.\nRegional Analysis: Conduct separate analyses for different regions (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa) to account for regional variations in cultural, economic, and political factors that could influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism independently.\nEconomic Controls: Include GDP per capita and economic growth rates in your model to control for the overall economic environment of the country, which could independently affect tourism volumes.\nTime-Lagged Variables: I could use lagged values (1-2 years) of the LGBTQ+ friendliness measures to examine if changes in LGBTQ+ policies impact tourism with a time delay, which would help clarify direction (not that I am particularly concerned about tourism rates impacting LGBTQ+ friendliness)\nDifference-in-Differences: I could empoy a difference-in-differences approach where I compare changes in tourism volumes in countries that improved on LGBTQ+ legislation against those that did not over the same period. The only issue is then I would have to pick a specific year and then that would reduce the models range. However this could help cover countries that were already improving/not improving at a steady rate."

Noteably in helping me code in time saving measures (instead of calculating the percent change by hand for 12+ variables and over 9 times each) I got it to give me the code to do it automatically. Moreover, especially with the chaos that is pivoting I used it to help me ID rows using str type commands. I also used GPT4 to help with editing, debugging, trying to use python instead (did not go with in the end), as well as some editing/rephrasing and reworking of my explanations and responses. Moreover, I used it to help brainstorm some potential confounders (was okay at doing it) and then also used it to help brainstorm remedies (was meh at it)."

    "text": "Task 2: Data\nData Souces\nIn this research, I am employing two different data sources. In order to asses the dependent/outcome variable, tourism volume, I am utilizing the World Bank’s International tourism, number of arrivals measures “International Tourist Arrivals” (n.d.). The downloadable data set has data at the country and year level. For example, it has the number of tourist arrivals to the United States in 2014. Note that the data is not perfect, there is some missing data for specific countries and years.\nThe second datset is the from the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide which pubishes yearly reports on each country and variety of different metrics, from whether or not Pride festivals and parades are banned in a given country and year to whether there is HIV-related travel restrictions.\nWhile the data was relatively complete, I did narrow down the years I would work with. I decided to not use any data starting from Janurary 1, 2020, to remove the issue with COVID-related travel dilemmas. Because the Gay Travel Guide only begins in 2012, the final window is for 2012-2019 and for all countries that existed in both the Gay Travel Guide and the World Bank Travel Data.\nDiscussion of key variables\nDependent Variable\n\nTourism volume percent change from the previous year (tour_pct):\n\nFinal unit of analysis is by country and year. Sample is not just countries but also territories (ex: US Virgin Islands), regions (ex: MENA), and other buckets such as income buckets (developing) which I discarded.\n\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nTotal\n\nThis represents the total score a country gets in a given year from the Gay Spartacus Travel Index. Each country was scored startingon a variety of different features (see other variables). Scores centered around 0 and countries can either earn points or loose points. The GSTI cites a variety of different sources including IGLA, Rainbow Europe, the UN, and more.\nIn order to get this into a workable format I had to get PDFs to EXCLs to CSVs and then spend a lot of time cleaning the data, pivoting, merging re-poviting, etc. See above code segements for more specifics, but I got the unit of analysis down to country year, such that the df looks like: Country, Year, Total, Specific LGBT variable 1, Specific LGBT variable 2, Specific LGBT variable …n. Sample ranges specifically from year to year but generally includes UN-recognized countries.\n\nAdoption allowed: This is a pretty clear measure where its very simple to see whether or not adoption is allowed, and for the most part this functions as a binary variable.\nAntidiscrimination: “With regard to anti-discrimination laws up to 3 points can be awarded, making a distinction, for example, whether the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the constitution or only in a law for a specific area is shown.” (direct wording from the GSTI).\nMarriage / Partnership: is the status on same-sex marriage, partnerships, and unions look like. A higher score indicates that they have gay marriage, lower scores correlate with other forms of relationships or none allowed at all\nEqual Age of Consent: Whether or not the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual sex is the same (binary).\nReligious Influence: What is the level of religious influence on the country mostly, scores 0 or a negative value (stronger religious influence).\nHIV Travel Restrictions : Is there travel restrictions on those with HIV, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (restrictions).\nAnti-Gay Laws: Are there laws that are discriminatory to LGB communities, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (laws).\nHomosexuality illegal: Is homosexuality explicitly criminalized, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (criminalized).\nPride Banned: Are Pride celebrations, festivals, or marches banned in the country, binary variable 0 (no ban) or -1 (ban).\nLocals Hostile: Are locals hostile to LGB individuals, 0 (not), and -1 (yes), -2 (yes, greater extent)… so forth.\nProsecution: Can indivudals be prosecuted for being LGB, 0 (not) and negative values for increasing severity.\nMurders: are there murders motivated on sexual orientation or gender identity in the country, binary 0 (none) and -2 (some).\nDeath Penalty: “Countries in which the death sentences for homosexuals is enshrined in law but is no longer performed have received one negative point.

    "text": "Task 4: Empirical Extension\nI’m not 100% percent sure what exactly I want to use as the empirical extension (or multiple of them), so I just wanted to give you a few options and then I also booked time for us to chat on Friday to workshop it together.\nThere are a variety of ways to help strengthen our conclusion, even if it is that there is no relationship between these variables. Below are some things that I could empoy, considering that my main model is listed above.\n\nNew Index Variables: Add an additional mode that instead of just total score as the independent variable, use all the sub components of the total. By doing this I could isolate to see if there is something specific that matters and not necessarily just the total score. In this I could also try many different combinations, where I hypothesize that these are the subcomponents that I think will have an impact on tourism and then use those or even create an index variable for it and then control it against the factors that I don’t think matter.\nYear Fixed Effects: While my main model is already employing an effect simiar to fixed effects by doing country percent change, I could employ fixed effects for the year. For example, what if global tourism just declined in 2018? This then could help absorb some of those shocks. Not only could this help remove the effect of year, it also (partially) helps mediate concerns about global macroeconomic conditions that would impede or support increased tourism.\nCountry Fixed Effects: Implement country fixed effects in my regression models to control for all time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between countries, which might influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism. This is also partially accounted for by %change but there could be other factors (for ex maybe this shows me that only particular regions is there an actual relationsip)\nSimplifying the model: I could try to run a mode that predicts a just the direction of tourism change. Instead of having it be a continous variable I could make it just an binary variable that represents whether or not the country experienced an increase or a decrease in tourism.\nRegional Analysis: Conduct separate analyses for different regions (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa) to account for regional variations in cultural, economic, and political factors that could influence both LGBTQ+ rights and tourism independently.\nEconomic Controls: Include GDP per capita and economic growth rates in your model to control for the overall economic environment of the country, which could independently affect tourism volumes.\nTime-Lagged Variables: I could use lagged values (1-2 years) of the LGBTQ+ friendliness measures to examine if changes in LGBTQ+ policies impact tourism with a time delay, which would help clarify direction (not that I am particularly concerned about tourism rates impacting LGBTQ+ friendliness)\nDifference-in-Differences: I could empoy a difference-in-differences approach where I compare changes in tourism volumes in countries that improved on LGBTQ+ legislation against those that did not over the same period. The only issue is then I would have to pick a specific year and then that would reduce the models range. However this could help cover countries that were already improving/not improving at a steady rate."

Will work with you on Fri to troubleshoot.\nA note on AI\nI used GPT4 many times throughout this assignment. Noteably in helping me code in time saving measures (instead of calculating the percent change by hand for 12+ variables and over 9 times each) I got it to give me the code to do it automatically. Moreover, especially with the chaos that is pivoting I used it to help me ID rows using str type commands. I also used GPT4 to help with editing, debugging, trying to use python instead (did not go with in the end), as well as some editing/rephrasing and reworking of my explanations and responses. Moreover, I used it to help brainstorm some potential confounders (was okay at doing it) and then also used it to help brainstorm remedies (was meh at it)."

Zimbabwe.\nThere are over 65 countries and territories that actively criminalize homosexuality Human Rights Watch (2023). 7 punish homosexuality by the death penalty Human Rights Watch (2023). From the Anti-LGBTQ 2023 legislation in Uganda Williams Institute (2023) to Iraq’s April 2024 legislation further criminalizing homosexuality PBS NewsHour (2023), many countries in the world are actively regressing on LGBTQ rights. While some research has been conducted on the economic impacts of LGBTQ rights for countries, I hope to further consider how anti-LGBTQ measures effect, specifically, country tourism.\nExploring the intersection of LGBTQ+ rights and how the tourism industry makes clear compelling insights into how inclusivity can shape economic landscapes. This research project delves into whether a nation’s commitment to LGBTQ+ rights can enhance its appeal as a tourism destination, a concept that holds both economic promise and social significance. This research inquiry is particularly pertinent in light of recent shifts globally and aligns with the broader quest for social equity, epitomized by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal to reduce inequalities United Nations (2023).\nSeveral studies have laid the groundwork for understanding this relationship. Monaco’s investigation into the travel preferences of Italian LGBT Millennials reveals how societal attitudes significantly influence destination choices Monaco (2022). This study highlights the importance of ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors in shaping travel decisions but stops short of linking these behaviors directly to economic outcomes and also focuses specifically on only one tourist demographic: Italian LGBT Millennials. Furthermore, research from the Williams Institute at UCLA Badgett et al. (2014) presents a macroeconomic view, demonstrating a positive correlation between LGBT inclusivity and economic performance in 39 countries. While these findings suggest that inclusive policies contribute to economic strength, they primarily focus on broad economic indicators rather than specific tourism metrics. The IGLTA Foundation provides valuable demographic and economic data about LGBTQ+ travelers, underscoring the economic potential of LGBTQ+ friendly tourism practices. The foundation recently released a report to understand how Florida’s recent anti-LGBTQ measures effect its perception as an international tourist destination. They find that nearly half of global survey respondents view Florida as unwelcoming to LGBTQ+ individuals and that there is decreased interest in traveling to Florida among the respondents. While this research seeks to understand the relationship between tourism and LGBTQ+ measures, it focuses soley on one region and relies on survey data and not economic outcomes International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (2023).\nAddressing these gaps, my research aims to directly correlate LGBTQ+ inclusivity, as measured by an index from the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide, with tangible tourism outcomes, specifically tourism volume. Further, I aim to focus on not just one country or region, but rather the enitre globe. By employing a quantitative angle, this study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of how rights and inclusivity translate into economic benefits for destinations. Through this approach, the research not only substantiates the economic arguments for greater inclusivity but also enhances our comprehension of its broader social ramifications."

    "text": "Research Design\nIn this section, I will cover the research design of this project. First I will cover some background on the two data sources I am using, as well as discuss some limitations to the data and how I moved forward. Secondly, I will discuss each of the key variables I am using from these datasets, and how they tie into my hypothesis as well as include a few vizualtions to help contenxtualize the some of these variables. Then, I will specify and defend my main regression model to test the hypothesis. I’ll also discuss some potential covariates, unobserved cofounders, and other casual concerns that could effect the interpretability of the model. In addition to the limitations of the model, I will offer two different empirical extensions that could help further test the model: a region * idependent variable interaction term and adding a time lag of one year between the independent and dependent variables.\n\nData Sources\nIn this research, I am employing two different data sources. In order to asses the dependent/outcome variable, tourism volume, I am utilizing the World Bank’s International tourism, number of arrivals measures “International Tourist Arrivals” (n.d.). The downloadable data set has data at the country and year level. For example, it has the number of tourist arrivals to the United States in 2014. Note that the data is not perfect, there is some missing data for specific countries and years.\nThe second datset is the from the Spartacus Gay Travel Guide which publishes yearly reports on each country and variety of different metrics, from whether or not Pride festivals and parades are banned in a given country and year to whether there is HIV-related travel restrictions Spartacus (2024). There are some limitations to this guide, including limited information on the specific methodology employed. They cite a variety of legitamite sources to create the index, but additional clarity on specific point attributions and more detailed variable explanations could be helpful. Note also that some reports don’t include every country and reports sometimes include country and occupied terrorities as seperate entities. In cleaning the data I did my best to keep as many observations as possible and modified the naming where relevant.\nMoreover, while the data was relatively complete, I did narrow down the years I would work with. I decided to not use any data starting from January 1, 2020, to remove the issue with COVID-related travel dilemmas. Because the Gay Travel Guide only begins in 2012, the final window is for 2012-2019 and for all countries that existed in both the Gay Travel Guide and the World Bank Travel Data.\n\n\nDiscussion of key variables\nDependent Variable\n\nTourism volume percent change from the previous year (tour_pct):\n\nFinal unit of analysis is by country and year. Sample is not just countries but also territories (ex: US Virgin Islands), regions (ex: MENA), and other buckets such as income buckets (developing) which I discarded.\n\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nTotal\n\nThis represents the total score a country gets in a given year from the Gay Spartacus Travel Index. Each country was scored startingon a variety of different features (see other variables). Scores centered around 0 and countries can either earn points or loose points. The GSTI cites a variety of different sources including IGLA, Rainbow Europe, the UN, and more.\nIn order to get this into a workable format I had to get PDFs to EXCLs to CSVs and then spend a lot of time cleaning the data, pivoting, merging re-poviting, etc. See above code segements for more specifics, but I got the unit of analysis down to country year, such that the df looks like: Country, Year, Total, Specific LGBT variable 1, Specific LGBT variable 2, Specific LGBT variable …n. Sample ranges specifically from year to year but generally includes UN-recognized countries.\n\nAdoption allowed: This is a pretty clear measure where its very simple to see whether or not adoption is allowed, and for the most part this functions as a binary variable.\nAntidiscrimination: “With regard to anti-discrimination laws up to 3 points can be awarded, making a distinction, for example, whether the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the constitution or only in a law for a specific area is shown.” (direct wording from the GSTI).\nMarriage / Partnership: is the status on same-sex marriage, partnerships, and unions look like. A higher score indicates that they have gay marriage, lower scores correlate with other forms of relationships or none allowed at all\nEqual Age of Consent: Whether or not the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual sex is the same (binary).\nReligious Influence: What is the level of religious influence on the country mostly, scores 0 or a negative value (stronger religious influence).\nHIV Travel Restrictions : Is there travel restrictions on those with HIV, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (restrictions).\nAnti-Gay Laws: Are there laws that are discriminatory to LGB communities, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (laws).\nHomosexuality illegal: Is homosexuality explicitly criminalized, binary variable 0 (none) or -1 (criminalized).\nPride Banned: Are Pride celebrations, festivals, or marches banned in the country, binary variable 0 (no ban) or -1 (ban).\nLocals Hostile: Are locals hostile to LGB individuals, 0 (not), and -1 (yes), -2 (yes, greater extent)… so forth.\nProsecution: Can indivudals be prosecuted for being LGB, 0 (not) and negative values for increasing severity.\nMurders: are there murders motivated on sexual orientation or gender identity in the country, binary 0 (none) and -2 (some).\nDeath Penalty: “Countries in which the death sentences for homosexuals is enshrined in law but is no longer performed have received one negative point. If people are still executed in a country because of their homosexuality, the country has been given five negative points.”\nLGBT-Marketing: Is there specific travel related marketing to LGBT individuals, binary variable 0 (none) or 1 (some).\n\nWhy are these variables important in helping asses the hypothesis?\nThese variables and data sources are the most ideal at assesing my hypothesis. The dependent variable, tourism, is accurately measured by the number of arrivals. I chose this over other variables such as dollars spent per visit, avergae length of visit, size of the tourist economy, or others that did not directly asses the movement of people. Because I hypothesize that people change their tourism plans as a result of LGBT friendliness, using number of people as my unit of analysis is the most apt. Secondly, the independent variables, LGBT friendliness, are also apt at supporting my hypothesis. These variables, including the total score accruately measure LGBT conditions in a given country and connect neatly to my hypothesis.\n\n\nVisualizations and Contextualization of Variables\nBecause I am taking the difference in both my independent variables, LGBT measures, as well as my dependent variables, below is a table showcasing some statistics on dependent variables after they have modified to show the change over time. I decided to showcase it this way as it is more representative of the data I will use in the regressions I will use later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics for CHANGE in All Variables\n\n\nVariable\nMin\nQ1\nQ2\nMean\nQ3\nQ4\nMax\n\n\n\n\nTourism Percent Change\n-67.3\n0.7\n5.1\n6.5\n10.5\n205.9\n205.9\n\n\nTotal LGBTQ+ Friendliness\n-5.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.0\n4.0\n4.0\n\n\nAdoption allowed\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nAnitdiscrimination\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.1\n0.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\nAnti-gay laws\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nDeath sentences\n-5.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n4.0\n4.0\n\n\nEqual Age of Consent\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nHIV-travel restrictions\n-2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nHomosexuality illegal\n-2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nLGBT-Marketing\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nLocals hostile\n-2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nMarriage / Partnership\n-1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nMurders\n-5.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n5.0\n5.0\n\n\nPride banned\n-2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nProsecution\n-2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\nReligious influence\n-3.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it is evident, because this is looking at the statistics in the change of variables from one year to the next, it does not tell us much on the LGBT side of things, this is because most countries simply do not observe changes from one year to the next and such the mean and median tend to be 0. Given this, I think it could be valuable to just view a chart and graph of just the raw independent (LGBTQ) variables, not the modified variables (change from the prior year to the next).
